BUSINESS JUSTIFICATION
On many accasiones business teams such as marketing, analytics and others may need users data from a given Social Network platform, such as
LinkdIn, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or any other to validate/use on their projects. This may not only be users' contact info but other
attibutes as profession, skills, interest and other items that could be valuable to business to make informed decisions and be scraped 
from those platforms. Manually achiving this task may be tedious, time consuming and sometimes impossible due to volume of data to be 
collected. Therefore having a script that is able to gather those data points at minimal amount of time and no manual human intervention can 
be extremely cost efficient.

 7. Save contact info into a new list of contacts
 8. Repeat the process for every name on the list
 9. Save the final list with contact info into a file in a given directory
